## Commentaries

I'm a beginner with Typescript , it's been a lonnnnng time since I didn't do a project with, so be kind ! :)
Same thing with tests, in my previous experiences, no tests in front and few in back so any tips/guidance on them is welcomed, i'm a fast learner !
Fun test and i did learn a lot with it, so a big thank you ! :D
